# Iris Dataset ML Pipeline

Welcome to the **Iris Dataset ML Pipeline**! This project demonstrates the complete pipeline for training and evaluating a machine learning model using the Iris dataset with **Scikit-Learn**.

---

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the machine learning community. It contains data about three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The objective is to classify the flowers based on these features.

## Workflow Summary

### **1. Data Loading**
We load the Iris dataset from Scikit-Learn's built-in datasets.

### **2. Data Preparation**
We prepare the data by organizing it into a DataFrame for better visualization and manipulation.

### **3. Data Splitting**
We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### **4. Model Pipeline Definition**
We define a pipeline that includes:
- **StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
- **Logistic Regression** as the classification model.

### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**
We train the model using the training dataset and evaluate its accuracy using the testing set.

## Why Use a Pipeline?

Using a pipeline ensures a streamlined and reproducible workflow. It handles data preprocessing and model training in a single structure, reducing the risk of data leakage and simplifying the development process.

---

## Results

The pipeline's model achieved an impressive accuracy score, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify the iris flowers.
